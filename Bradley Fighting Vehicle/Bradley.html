<h1> A Quick Introduction </h1>

<hr class="style1">

<p>The M3A3 or M3A2 Bradley fighting vehicle is arguably the most versatile fighting vehicle in the U.S. Army's arsenal. With multiple uses throughout the force, the <br/> 
Bradley Fighting Vehicle is extremely valuable in today's ever changing environment. While many in the higher levels of the U.S. Military 
Argue the validity of this<br/> particular vehicle, the soldiers who use it on a regular basis have grown to love the vehicle. </p> 

  <a id="H"> <h2> History </h2> </a>
<p>The Bradley Fighting Vehicle is named after the famous <a href="GeneralBradley.html">General Omar Bradley</a> who is known for his distingushed service during World War II. The M2A2 vehicle <br/> 
is most widley known 
from the 1998 film <em>The Pentagon Wars</em>, which depicts the multiple failed attempts and the billions of dollars spent developing this mobile <br/> weapon system. The BFV was first put into 
service in 1981, and continues to serve as a favorite of the armored community to this day.</p>

<p>During the Gulf War, M2 Bradleys destroyed more Iraqi armored vehicles than the M1 Abrams. A total of 20 Bradleys were lost—three by enemy fire and 17 due to friendly<br/> fire incidents; another
 12 were damaged. The gunner of one Bradley was killed when his vehicle was hit by Iraqi fire, possibly from an Iraqi BMP-1, during the Battle of 73 Easting.<br/> To remedy some problems that were 
 identified as contributing factors in the friendly fire incidents, infrared identification panels and other <br/>marking/identification measures were added to the Bradleys.</p>

<a id="V"> <h2> Variants </h2> </a>

<p>There are two major variants to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and one minor variant, all of which are built on the same chassis. The M3A3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle <br/> is the newest variant of the 
Bradley series, while it is just as mobile and lethal as the original bradley, upgrades to the optics allow for this vehicle to be able to observe<br/> enemy and vehicles from miles away, making this
 particular variant ideal for an armored reconnaissance vehicle. The M3A2 also known as the infantry fighting vehicle<br/> is equipped with the same weapon system and optics as the M3A3, but has a greater
 troop carrying capacity, making this variant great for armored troop transport<br/> or armored assaults requiring infantry support. the minor variant is still in the M3A3 family but is known as the BFST 
 vehicle, or Bradley Fire Support Vehicle. This<br/> variant is equipped with a fire support computer to aid in the direction of artillery fire. </p>
